# Dark Luxury Editorial Web

Use this skill to turn travel text or travel intent into a warm, restrained, benchmark-family editorial microsite.

The target feeling is:

- cinematic but quiet
- human, not system-like
- photography-led
- mobile-first
- shareable as a real destination page, not a demo shell

## Primary promise

This skill helps Codex make a route guide or memoir page that feels like the shipped Xishuangbanna / Jingshan family:

- strong Hero cover
- seamless Hero-to-second-screen continuity
- elegant itinerary structure
- restrained motion
- real imagery
- optional BGM with a real player state

## Progressive disclosure contract

This file is the entry router, not the full manual.

Default behavior:

1. read this file first
2. identify the task shape
3. load only the one or two reference files needed for that task
4. avoid bulk-loading every reference unless the task truly spans planning, writing, design, assets, and deployment at once

If the task is narrow, keep context narrow.

Examples:

- user gives only travel intent
  - read `references/intent-to-itinerary-planning.md`
  - then read `references/workflow-from-brief-to-site.md`
- user gives a finished route guide or memoir draft
  - read `references/workflow-from-brief-to-site.md`
- user says the page looks off
  - read `references/benchmark-project-family.md`
  - then `references/implementation-recipes.md`
- user says the pictures or music feel wrong
  - read `references/image-and-audio-pipeline.md`

## Soul rules

These are the rules that, if broken, the page stops belonging to the benchmark family — even when everything else is technically correct. They describe *what kind of page this is*, not how to implement it. Concrete recipes (Tailwind classes, overlay opacity, layout grids) live in `references/implementation-recipes.md`.

1. **Project boundaries.** Don't overwrite a different destination project unless the user explicitly asks to replace it.
2. **Hero and the next section are one composition.** Continuity comes from shared imagery and masking; if the second screen reads as a separate slab, the cover has failed.
3. **Real, semantically-fit imagery is the floor.** A page with text-only dark shells, flat SVGs, muddy stock, or factually-correct-but-visually-flat photos doesn't belong to this family. Editorial beauty and semantic fit are both required, not either-or.
4. **Copy sounds like a human travel companion.** Not a planner console, audit log, or system report. Concrete tags (`place` / `food`) over abstract labels; first-person warmth over template phrasing.
5. **Backstage rigor, frontstage warmth.** Map validation, weather adaptation, template selection are real backstage work for 0-to-1 planning — but they should not surface as visible dashboards, KPI blocks, validation panels, or repeated module shells. That's what tips a page over into AI UI.
6. **Hero readability is non-optional.** Title and supporting copy must be clearly legible against the cover, and the title block must read as optically centered. If the photo can't carry the text, strengthen the contrast layer or rewrite the label — don't ship low-contrast or off-center as "good enough". See implementation-recipes section 1-3 for the layered overlay pattern and centering recipe.
7. **Simplify or omit before shipping a weak version.** If the route loop, timeline, or vinyl player can't reach benchmark quality, drop the module. A clean page missing a feature beats a page with a broken signature interaction.
8. **Mobile is a first-class review surface.** Not a later cleanup pass.
9. **A cold-start ships only with evidence.** Public deploy URL plus browser-verified visual review, or a clearly documented blocker. No "looks good in dev".

## Choose the path

### 1. User only gives travel intent

Examples:

- “从哪里去哪里，做一个几天几夜路书”
- “帮我规划一个适合家庭 / staycation / 自驾的行程”

Read:

1. `references/intent-to-itinerary-planning.md`
2. `references/workflow-from-brief-to-site.md`

Use this path when the job includes planning the trip itself before building the page.

### 2. User gives route-guide text, notes, doc, Notion, Feishu export, or partial page

Read:

1. `references/workflow-from-brief-to-site.md`

Then load additional references only as needed:

- writing tone
  - `references/editorial-writing-and-mood-mapping.md`
- visuals regressed
  - `references/benchmark-project-family.md`
  - `references/implementation-recipes.md`
- assets or music need sourcing
  - `references/image-and-audio-pipeline.md`

### 3. User is refining an existing benchmark-family site

This is usually a visual-regression or interaction-polish task.

Read:

1. `references/benchmark-project-family.md`
2. `references/implementation-recipes.md`
3. `references/failure-modes-and-qa.md`

Use this path for:

- Hero centering drift
- Hero / second-screen seam
- timeline misalignment
- player inconsistency
- too many cards / modules
- imagery that feels random or plain

### 4. User is mainly asking about images, music, or asset sourcing

Read:

1. `references/image-and-audio-pipeline.md`

This file covers:

- Pixabay-first sourcing
- Pinterest for scene discovery
- fallback order
- editorial beauty filter
- music recommendation flow
- provenance rules

### 5. User mainly needs copy shaping or memoir restoration

Read:

1. `references/editorial-writing-and-mood-mapping.md`

Use this when the page needs:

- more first-person warmth
- less AI summary language
- cleaner route-guide phrasing
- better mood-to-shot mapping

### 6. User wants reusable implementation patterns

Read:

1. `references/implementation-recipes.md`

Use this for:

- Hero layering
- title axis handling
- timeline node treatment
- route-loop presentation
- image surfaces
- audio engine behavior
- font delivery control

### 7. User wants future product evolution, not just today’s skill

Read:

1. `references/skill-to-product-evolution.md`

This is for forward planning such as `Plan -> Trip -> Memoir` productization, not for normal page delivery.

## Default operating sequence

Unless the task is unusually narrow, the safest sequence is:

1. protect project boundaries
2. determine whether this is planning, transformation, or refinement
3. load the minimum needed reference
4. normalize the content before styling
5. fix structure before effects
6. source real assets before calling the page complete
7. run mobile review before deployment
8. deploy and browser-check before final signoff

## Output expectations

### For 0-to-1 route-guide creation

Expected backstage artifacts:

- planning artifact
- research record
- real local image assets
- optional music provenance

Expected delivery state:

- built page
- public Vercel URL or a real blocker
- browser verification with visual evidence

### For refinement work

Expected delivery state:

- the regression is fixed in code
- the benchmark family is preserved
- no new module language is introduced casually

## Reference map

Read only the file you need:

- [benchmark-project-family.md](references/benchmark-project-family.md)
  Visual baseline, pass/fail sniff test, benchmark-family rules.
- [workflow-from-brief-to-site.md](references/workflow-from-brief-to-site.md)
  End-to-end build flow from raw travel material to deployed page.
- [intent-to-itinerary-planning.md](references/intent-to-itinerary-planning.md)
  0-to-1 planning logic, template selection, research stack, map and weather rules.
- [image-and-audio-pipeline.md](references/image-and-audio-pipeline.md)
  Shot list, image sourcing, beauty filter, music selection, provenance, fallback.
- [implementation-recipes.md](references/implementation-recipes.md)
  Concrete React + Tailwind patterns for the benchmark family.
- [editorial-writing-and-mood-mapping.md](references/editorial-writing-and-mood-mapping.md)
  Human-facing copy constraints and mood-to-visual translation.
- [failure-modes-and-qa.md](references/failure-modes-and-qa.md)
  Common failure patterns, regression triage, and final QA checks.
- [skill-to-product-evolution.md](references/skill-to-product-evolution.md)
  Product evolution thinking beyond the current skill.

## Preferred external helpers

These are optional helpers, not hard prerequisites.
If unavailable, keep the capability and use web fallbacks rather than blocking.

- mainland-China map primary
  - `skills.volces.com@amap-maps`
- global map supplement
  - `tivojn/google-maps-api-skill@google-maps-api`
- weather primary
  - `skills.volces.com@weather-openmeteo`
- weather fallback
  - `chandima/agent-skills@weather`

If the current environment lacks map or weather capability:

1. try installing an appropriate helper through `skills`
2. if installation fails, record that in the research artifact
3. continue with documented map / official-web / forecast fallback

## Final reminder

This skill does not define success as “a dark page with travel text”.
It defines success as:

- a benchmark-family editorial travel page
- with human warmth
- real route logic backstage
- beautiful and section-matched assets
- and a polished mobile experience

If the result still reads like a prototype, dashboard, or AI summary shell, it has not passed.
